# python_AIML
Author: Fabio Llorella, email:fricardocorreo@gmail.com

With this repository is intended to create a set of tools to facilitate working with AIML files using Python.

Is intended to be an iterator, where you can search if there is a pattern of knowledge, insert new knowledge, delete knowledge, this would be the first thing to do as first version, then my idea would be to extend it to more actions and be able to use more than one AIML file at the same time to cross information and to be able to infer new knowledge.
